Create 'job packages' as products with their own price, listing duration, listing limit, and job featured status and either sell them via your store or during the job submission process. A user's packages are shown on their account page and can be used to post future jobs if they allow more than 1 job listing. Also allows 'resume packages' if using the resumes add-on."
