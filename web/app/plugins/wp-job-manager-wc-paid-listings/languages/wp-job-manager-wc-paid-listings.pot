msgid "Add paid listing functionality via WooCommerce. Create 'job packages' as products with their own price, listing duration, listing limit, and job featured status and either sell them via your store or during the job submission process. A user's packages are shown on their account page and can be used to post future jobs if they allow more than 1 job listing. Also allows 'resume packages' if using the resumes add-on."
