*** WordPress Job Manager alerts changelog ***

2024-04-29 - version 3.2.0
* New: Add job statistics about how many times the job was sent out in alert e-mails
* Dev: Add alert modal logged out version as template

2024-03-14 - version 3.1.1
* Fix jobs not being filtered by date for alert e-mails (#467)
* Fix: Update alert e-mail schedule when alert is edited in the admin screen (#469)

2024-02-20 - version 3.1.0

* Fix company name, logo, location not showing in alert e-mails by default
* Fix job tags that the user searches for not being part of the alert

2024-02-02 - version 3.0.0
* New: Accountless Alerts. A long requested feature, now a new option makes user registration optional for creating job alerts. Job seekers can create alerts just with their e-mail, and after receiving and clicking a verification link, they'll start getting alert e-mails just like registered users did. These guest users can also manage via magic links in the e-mails sent.
* New: HTML e-mails. The Alert e-mails are now formatted. Brand color can be customized, as well as whether company name/logo/location should be displayed for the jobs.
* New: Customize which job fields can be used for setting up alerts.
* New: Add Alert modal: Instead of navigating to a new page with a form, alerts can be added right from the job listing page. Clicking Add Alert opens a modal to create an alert for the current search.
* Fix: Fix shortcode handler only running in pages
* Fix: Fix job alert pre-filling data when clicking New Alert

Note: WP Job Manager version 2.2.1 is required for this release. 

Developer notes: 

* Refreshed frontend styles for elements like notices and the new modal
* Alerts switched to the e-mail system of the core plugin
* New HTML variants for the alert and confirmation e-mails
* Template updates for the shortcode and new templates for e-mails and the alert modal
* General code refactoring
* Accountless alerts functionality uses a new guest user concept, implemented in the core plugin. These users are stored as a CPT, and authenticate to manage their alerts via tokens in the URL

If you customize Job Alerts templates in a theme, the templates will need to be updated to work with the new features. If you integrate with the add-on in another way, nothing should break, but please test and check if any code needs to be updated.
